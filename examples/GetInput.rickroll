take me to ur heart
    # Same as `import sys` in python
    we know the sys and we're gonna play it

    # Ask for input
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling "What is your name?\n"

    give name up sys.stdin.readline()

    #print(f"hello {name}")
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling "hello " + name + "\n"

say goodbye
